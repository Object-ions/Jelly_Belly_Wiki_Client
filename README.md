# Jelly Belly Wiki Client

## Project Overview

This repository, **Jelly_Belly_Wiki_Client**, is part of a larger project that is divided into three main segments:

1. **Capstone Supporting Files**: [Capstone Supporting Files Repository](https://github.com/Object-ions/capstone-supporting-files): A repository dedicated to scripts and supporting files for data collection, primarily using Python for web scraping from the official Jelly Belly website.

2. **Jelly-Belly-Wiki-API**: [Jelly-Belly-Wiki-API Repository](https://github.com/Object-ions/Jelly-Belly-Wiki-API): This repository contains the API implementation and the seeded data from the scraping process. The API is built using C# and EF Core .Net with MySql migrations.

3. **UI (This Repository)**: The client-side component focusing on user interface and interaction. It includes all frontend development, offering a visually appealing and functional user experience.

## Explore the project:

By dividing my project into these three distinct parts, I aim to create a comprehensive and efficient solution that encompasses data collection, user interaction, and data retrieval through an API. Feel free to explore each repository for more details and contributions.

# Project Overview

This repository represents the User Interface (UI) section of my entire project, which is divided into three main components:

## 1. Capstone Supporting Files

[Capstone Supporting Files Repository](https://github.com/Object-ions/capstone-supporting-files)

This repository is dedicated to scripts and supporting files essential for my project. The scripts, written in Python, are designed to scrape data from the official website. The output of these scripts includes JSON and text files containing the data extracted from the website.

## 2. Jelly-Belly-Wiki-API

[Jelly-Belly-Wiki-API Repository](https://github.com/Object-ions/Jelly-Belly-Wiki-API)

The third part of my project resides in this repository. Here, you will find the API implementation along with the seeded data obtained from the scraping process carried out in the first part. This API facilitates various functionalities, including query searches and more, providing an interface for accessing and utilizing the scraped data.

## 3. UI (This Repository)

This repository, the one you are currently in, serves as the client-side component of my project. It encompasses all aspects of the user interface, including graphics, styles, and various components. In essence, this repository represents the frontend of my project, offering a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

By dividing my project into these three distinct parts, I aim to create a comprehensive and efficient solution that encompasses data collection, user interaction, and data retrieval through an API. Feel free to explore each repository for more details and contributions.
